These are release notes for VMware Tanzu Observability by Wavefront Nozzle.

##<a id="3-0-4"></a> v3.0.4

**Release Date:** December 15, 2021

* Addresses [CVE 2021-44228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228).



## Workaround for Log4j CVE

If you are unable to upgrade VMware Tanzu Observability by Wavefront Nozzle to v3.0.4,
complete the workaround described below to address Log4j vulnerabilities.

This recommendation is based on this guidance from the Apache Software Foundation:

```
In any release other than 2.16.0, you may remove the JndiLookup class from the classpath:
zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class`
```

For the VMware Tanzu Observability by Wavefront Nozzle tile, the command is slightly different
from the guidance because the class file to be removed is built into `wavefront-proxy.jar`.

### Procedure

To remove the JndiLookup class from the classpath from the VMware Tanzu Observability by Wavefront Nozzle tile:

1. Run:

    ```
    zip -q -d wavefront-proxy.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class
    ```

1. Get access to the JAR file inside the `.pivotal` by running:

    ```
    SOMETHING releases/wavefront-proxy-${VERSION}.tgz/packages/wavefront_proxy_pkg.tgz/wavefront-proxy.jar
    ```

    Where is `VERSION` is the version of the VMware Tanzu Observability by Wavefront Nozzle tile you have installed???

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ SOMETHING releases/wavefront-proxy-${3.0.3}.tgz/packages/wavefront_proxy_pkg.tgz/wavefront-proxy.jar
    </pre>
